# Ambukance Path Clearance ðŸš‘

##  Problem Statement
Traffic management is something that is often overlooked. 
As a consequence, ambulances at times do not have a clear path to 
take and end up becoming a part of the congestion.  
At crossroads, traffic signals are manually turned green to give clearance for an ambulance to pass.  
This might lead to casualties as time is of utmost importance.

## Solution
An Application service that :

- Notifies the vehicles about the ambulanceâ€™s location when the vehicle is at a particular distance from the ambulance.

- Ambulance choose the fastest route to reach the hospital  
    - Based on features like : potholes, traffic etc.
- Traffic signal light turns green when the ambulance is at a close proximity range from the traffic pole.
