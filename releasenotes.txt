Added preferences. Now, the app will remember who is the user (regular user / ambulance driver) even after the app is closed (preferences).
Button to reset the preferences added to test it out. Skip button should launch the map but since the SDK is non-functional, the button is non-functional as well.
Quit button quits the app.
